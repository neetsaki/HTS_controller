# HTS_controller
A code for controlling the time of high-temperature shock (HTS)

High temperature shock is a convenient tool for rapidly synthesizing nanomaterials but lack of the control of HTS time.
Herein, a code were given to do the HTS experiment within a given time (like 0.5 sec).

The code need the following package:
- python>=3.7
- flask == 1.0.2
- RPi.GPIO == 0.7.0

Installation of RPi.GPIO
`sudo apt-get install python3-rpi.gpio`
